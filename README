STRANGE BEHAVIOR:

// *********** SIMULATOR3D.CPP || UNCOUPLED ************* //

BUBBLE MODE:

 - static test
	fint = GTilde*heaviside -> not working p=0
  	fint = G*heaviside -> pressure is wrong
 - oscillating
    fint = GTilde*heaviside -> does not work
    fint = G*heaviside -> does not work
 - rising ( Mrho*g )
    fint = GTilde*heaviside -> work with overshooting and bubble deform
    fint = G*heaviside -> work with no overshooting --BEST--
         ( Mrho-M )*g
    fint = GTilde*heaviside -> overshooting, bubble deform and osc velocity
    fint = G*heaviside -> no overshooting, bubble ok and osc velocity

CALL: uv = uTilde + dt*invMLumped*fint + dt*invMrhoLumped*gravity;


DROPLET MODE:
 - static test
    fint = GTilde*heaviside -> not working p=0
	fint = G*heaviside -> pressure correct
 - oscillating test
    fint = GTilde*heaviside -> don't work
 	fint = G*heaviside -> work (not so good at the end), vel osc --BEST--
 - rising test: gravity = ( Mrho*g )
    fint = GTilde*heaviside -> overshooting, bubble deform
    fint = G*heaviside -> vel osc,
 - rising test: gravity = ( Mrho-M )*g
    fint = GTilde*heaviside -> osc velo, bubble deform, overshooting
    fint = G*heaviside -> osc velo, no overshooting, bubble ok

CALL uv = uTilde + invA*fint + invA*gravity;
